# Guide
[PyGal](http://www.pygal.org/en/stable/index.html) is a module that creates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) graphs and charts. PyGal offers in-depth customization but is simple and intuitive.

#Installation Steps
* First install PyGal, and import it as well.
  * !pip install PyGal
  * import PyGal
* Pandas allows us to import our needed dataset easily.
  * import pandas as pd
  * df = pd.read_csv('Insert CSV here.csv'

# Functionalities and Use Cases
PyGal's usage of SVG images allows your visualizations to be easily transported and embedded within websites or applications such as dashboards. The SVG preserves the integrity of the visualization's shapes, and gives you the option to make your images interactive and animated.
